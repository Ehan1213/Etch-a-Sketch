# Etch-A-Sketch Plan

## Main Project Requirements
 ### Grid Creation
     I will need to create a 16x16 grid. I think this can be 
     accomplished using a loop when the JS loads to draw the 256 divs. 
     I will also need to set a size for each one. They have to be square
     16px? The layout will be done via flexbox per the requirements.

 ### Hover Effect 
     1. The divs need to change color as the user mouse passes over 
     them.
      - Hovering starts with user entering div
      - Hovering ends with user exiting div 
    
     2. Divs can change color in a few ways
      - Adding a css class  
      - Changing color via JS

 ### Scaling Divs
     Add a button to the top of the screen to prompt the user to enter a 
     number max = 100. Based on user input draw a new grid with X by X 
     divs.
     - Current divs get removed 
     - New grid takes their place
     - The new divs take up the same amount of pixels
